										<h1> A Unified Theory of Group Decision Making  </h1>

									<h2> Group decisions and opinion exchange: role of persuasion </h2>
									<h3> Reasoning with neural networks </h3>
									<p>We have been continuing to study the dynamics of agreement and disagreement within groups, and have investigated network models for how adversaries can potentially inject disagreement into a group. We investigate the properties of such attacks, considering optimal strategies both for an adversary seeking to create disagreement and for potential countermeasures to make the group more robust against such attacks.  Surprisingly, we show that for analyzing the effect of these attacks, the entire spectrum of the underlying interaction network is relevant for evaluating the adversary's power; this contrasts with related problems in which it is typically only the extreme eigenvalues that govern the behavior. We also consider the algorithmic task of a network defender to mitigate these sorts of adversarial attacks, and show connections between the geometry of this problem and methods in convex programming. </p>
									<p>Furthermore, we have considered a popular scenario for distributed inference and learning whereby agents receive initial private (local) signals, and aim to take the best action given the aggregate observations of all other agents. Agents have access to estimates of their neighboring agents which are repeatedly updated. We study the implications of the information structure, the choice of the probability distributions for signal likelihoods and beliefs, and agents’ recent memory. These factors determine the structure of the update rules that express the future actions of agents in terms of their observations. We analyze the resulting linear updating of actions based on the observed neighboring actions and  show  that  many  inefficiencies  arise  in  group  decisions  due  to  repeated  interactions  between  individuals leading  to  choice-shifts  toward  extreme  actions.  Nevertheless balanced,  regular  networks demonstrate  a  measure  of  efficiency  in terms of aggregating the initial information of individuals.</p>

									<h3> The spread of misinformation </h3>
									<p> To better understand persuasion and its role in information spreading and other collective phenomena, we study a model of online news dissemination on a Twitter-like social network. Agents with heterogeneous Gaussian priors would decide whether to share a piece of news/new information they receive with their followers. Each agent makes a single sharing decision based on whether the new information can persuade her followers to move their beliefs closer to hers in aggregate. The question is, will there be a sharing cascade? Will the new information go virtual? And what is the connection between the new information going viral and credibility/precision of the news.</p>

									<h2> Group decision making: computational issues </h2>

									<hr class="'major" />
									<h3> Reasoning with neural networks </h3>
									<p> One way of understanding computational constraints is to see what is feasible by a computer program and to understand the limitations of such computations. Neural networks pro- vide a computational framework that provides human-comparable (or better) performance in tasks such as speech recognition or object detection. Despite their success, a criticism of such techniques is that they are limited to low-level tasks as opposed to more sophisticated reasoning. This gap has drawn analogies to the difference in so-called “System 1” (i.e., low-level perception and intuitive knowledge) and “System 2” (i.e., reasoning, planning, and imagination) thinking from Kahneman et al. in social psychology. Proposals for moving towards System 2 reasoning in machine learning systems involve creating new abilities for composition and combinatorial generalization. </p>
									<p> One approach for augmenting neural networks with these capabilities is performing relational reasoning over structured representations, such as sets. For relational reasoning, these systems are commonly split into two stages: (i) a perceptual stage that extracts structured sets of vector representations, intended to correspond to entities from the raw data, and (ii) a reasoning stage that uses these representations. Typical differentiable methods directly map the input to latent features using a feedforward neural network and partition the latent features into a set representation for downstream reasoning. However, we showed that these methods have a fundamental flaw — at a high level, if there exists a continuous map that generates inputs from entities, then any function that can map such inputs to a list representation of the entities must be discontinuous. For relational reasoning tasks, this implies the perceptual stage must contain discontinuities. Using a continuous feedforward network to approximate discontinuities leads to representation issues.</p>
									<p> To address these issues, we introduced a Set Refiner Network (SRN), a novel module that iteratively refines a proposed set using a set encode (Huang et al., submitted, 2020). The main idea of our module is that instead of directly mapping an input embedding to a set, we instead find a set representation that can be encoded to the input embedding. This procedure is a better model for discontinuities and can produce more meaningful set representations. In extensive, we demonstrated that the SRN can effectively decompose entities in a controlled setting. Furthermore, we found that incorporating our SRN into state-of-the-art relational reasoning pipelines in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing tasks improves prediction accuracy and robustness substantially.</p>
									<p> This research was conducted in collaboration with Facebook, and they are currently testing these ideas in their own machine learning pipelines. </p>

									<h2> Polarization </h2>

									<h3> A Geometric Model of Opinion Polarization. </h3>
									<p> Following up on our work on persuasion and polarization and to better understand issues related to group decision making dynamics, we introduce a simple, geometric model of opinion polarization. Our model can be construed as a model of political persuasion, as well as marketing and advertising, utilizing social values. It focuses on the interplay between different topics and wide-reaching persuasion efforts in the media. </p>
									<p>  We demonstrate that societal opinion polarization in our model often arises as an unintended byproduct of organizations attempting to sell an idea. We discuss some exploratory examples, analyzing how polarization occurs and evolves. We also examine some computational aspects of choosing the most effective means of influencing agents in our model, and the connections of those strategic considerations with polarization.
More specifically, we consider two scenarios: either there is one entity (an influencer) trying to persuade agents to adopt their opinion or there are two competing influencers pushing different agendas. With respect to the timescale of interventions, we also consider two cases: the influencer(s) can apply arbitrarily many interventions, i.e., the asymptotic setting, or they need to maximize influence with a limited number of interventions, i.e., the short-term setting. The questions asked are: (i) What sequence of interventions should be applied to achieve the influencer’s objective? (ii) What are the computational resources needed to compute this optimal sequence? (iii) What are the effects of applying the interventions on the population’s opinion structure? We give partial answers to those questions. The gist of them is that in most cases, applying desired interventions increases the polarization of agents.</p>
