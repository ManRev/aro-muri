									<h3> Opinion Dynamics under Social Pressure </h3>
									<p>We introduce a new opinion dynamics model where a group of agents holds two kinds of opinions: inherent and declared. Each agent's inherent opinion is fixed and unobservable by the other agents. At each time step, agents broadcast their declared opinions on a social network, which are governed by the agents' inherent opinions and social pressure. In particular, we assume that agents may declare opinions that are not aligned with their inherent opinions to conform with their neighbors.  </p>
									<p>This raises the natural question: Can we estimate the agents' inherent opinions from observations of declared opinions? For example, agents' inherent opinions may represent their true political alliances (Democrat or Republican), while their declared opinions may model the political inclinations of tweets on social media. In this context, we may seek to predict the election results by observing voters' tweets, which do not necessarily reflect their political support due to social pressure. We analyze this question in the special case where the underlying social network is a complete graph.   </p>
									<p>We prove that, as long as the population does not include large majorities, estimation of aggregate and individual inherent opinions is possible. On the other hand, large majorities force minorities to lie over time, which makes asymptotic estimation impossible.  </p>

									<h3> Native advertising and the credibility of news </h3>
									<p>The digitization of news publishing has resulted in new ways for advertisers to reach readers, including native advertising formats that blend with news content. Though native ads bring revenue to publishers, they redirect attention off-site and may affect perceptions of the publisher.  </p>
									<p>Using a combination of observations of ad content across many publishers and two large randomized experiments, we investigate the style and the impact of a native ad format that is pervasive when reading news. We collected and analyzed 1.4 million ad headlines. We found that over 80% of the ad headlines use a clickbait style, and that politics is among the most common topics in ads. Two randomized experiments (combined n = 9,807) varied the native ads present in news articles and asked people to assess the articles' credibility.  </p>
									<p>Experiment 1 suggested that different publishers were impacted differently by the ads and motivated the more detailed design of Experiment 2. The latter relied on contrasting ad sets that tested the effects of clickbait and political ads. Findings from this pre-registered experiment established that clickbait ads and, to a lesser extent, political ads, substantially reduce readers' perception of the articles' credibility. This phenomenon was driven by publishers with which less than 50% of the audience is familiar. These findings suggest that publishers that use clickbait native ads to ensure short-term financial revenues may diminish their audience's trust.   </p>
